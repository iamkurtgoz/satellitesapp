Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/iamkurtgoz/satellitesapp/releases) to download the latest APK.

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 24.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, utilizing [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous operations.
- Jetpack Libraries:
    - Jetpack Compose: Android‚Äôs modern toolkit for declarative UI development.
    - Lifecycle: Observes Android lifecycles and manages UI states upon lifecycle changes.
    - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data and is lifecycle-aware, ensuring data survival through configuration changes.
    - Navigation: Facilitates screen navigation, complemented by [Hilt Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#hilt) for dependency injection.
    - Room: Constructs a database with an SQLite abstraction layer for seamless database access.
    - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): Facilitates dependency injection.
- Architecture:
    - MVI Architecture (Model - View - Intent): The MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture treats user interactions or events as "Intents," which then lead to a state change observed by the "View." This approach centralizes all application state in one place, allowing for a single source of truth. MVI is particularly beneficial for managing complex user interactions, as it promotes consistent and understandable flows, improves testability, and simplifies debugging.
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson): Converts from json to object and from object to json.
- [Kotlin Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization): Kotlin multiplatform / multi-format reflectionless serialization.
- [ksp](https://github.com/google/ksp): Kotlin Symbol Processing API for code generation and analysis.
- [Turbine](https://github.com/cashapp/turbine): A small testing library for kotlinx.coroutines Flow.
